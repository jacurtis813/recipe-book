## Desription:

* Create a web page with your favorite recipes.
* The recipe book should have a table of contents linking to each recipe below, using internal links.
* Each recipe should have a table for the ingredients.
* A list of details, and a list and/or paragraphs of the steps required.
* If you use recipes from the internet, be sure to add a link to the website.
* Use CSS to style the recipe book, using a mix of the simple selectors and colors that you've learned.
* You can also bring in images from Wikipedia. To do that, use a site-restricted Google search, then click "View image" on the result you like, and copy the URL into your img tag.
